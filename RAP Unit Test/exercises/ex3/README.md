# Exercise 3: BO Tests - Write ABAP Unit Tests using Entity Manipulation Language (EML)

## Introduction

In the present exercise, you will test the behavior implementation of your _travel_ business object (BO) using Entity Manipulation Language (EML). This allows scenario testing where the operations on a RAP BOs are executed, with all the relevant side effects (e.g. determinations and validations) triggered at the appropriate time, and only the database dependencies are isolated.

Writing Tests for your Business Logic in RAP Business Objects (BOs)

You will write an ABAP Unit test for the business logic of the _travel_ BO node using EML in the separate ABAP class **`ZRAP400_TC_TRAVEL_EML_####`**, where **`####`** is your group ID - i.e. You will write an ABAP Unit test with test relation.

The scenario to be tested in the present exercise is the creation and manipulation of a new _travel_ instance.

The Code under Test (CUT) is the RAP BO behavior under a complex EML statement, including `CREATE`, `EXECUTE` and  `COMMIT` statements.

>**Additional information**:  
> EML is a part of the ABAP language that enables access to RAP business objects.   
> Writing ABAP Unit tests with test relations allow the tests to be executed from the referenced object.  
> You can find information on these topics in the online documentation on the SAP Help.

Let's get started! 

>Do not forget to always replace all occurrences of **`####`** with your chosen group ID in the exercise steps below.
    
## Exercise 3.1: Create the ABAP Unit test class

Create the ABAP Unit test **`ZRAP400_TC_TRAVEL_EML_####`** in your previously created exercise package.
 
1. Right-click on your package **`ZRAP400_TRAVEL_####`** and choose _**New > ABAP Class**_ from the context menu.      

   ![BO Test – Create Test Class](images/botestclass01.png)
 

2. Maintain **`ZRAP400_TC_TRAVEL_EML_####`** as name and a meaningful description (e.g. **_BO Tests using EML_**) in the creation wizard for the new ABAP class and choose **Next**.

   ![BO Test – Create Test Class](images/botestclass02.png)
 

3. Assign a transport request and choose **Finish**.
 
   The new class is now created, and the default content displayed in the editor.

   ![BO Test – Create Test Class](images/botestclass03.png)
 

4. Specify the class as ABAP Unit test class with test relation to the behavior definition (**`BDEF`**) of the _travel_ BO node ZRAP400_I_Travel_####.
    
   For that, specify the addition **`FOR TESTING RISK LEVEL HARMLESS DURATION SHORT`** at the end of the **`CLASS`** statement in the class definition to enable the class for ABAP Unit tests
   
    **<details><summary>Click here to expand the source code</summary>**
    <p>
   <pre>
      FOR TESTING
      RISK LEVEL HARMLESS
      DURATION SHORT
   </pre>
    </p>
    </details>   

   ... and add the **`@testing`** provided in the code snippet below at the top of editor to specify the Test relation with the behavior definition.
   
    **<details><summary>Click here to expand the source code</summary>**
    <p>

      "! @testing BDEF:ZRAP400_I_Travel_####
   </pre>
    </p>
    </details>
   

   ![BO Test – Create Test Class](images/botestclass04.png)
 

5. Save ![save icon](images/adt_save.png) the class.

## Exercise 3.2: Adjust the ABAP Unit test class definition

1.  Now enhance the class definition.  

    Insert the code snippet provided below under **`PRIVATE SECTION`** in the class definition as shown on the screenshot below.  

    **<details><summary>Click here to expand the source code</summary>**
    <p>
    <pre>
        CLASS-DATA:
          cds_test_environment TYPE REF TO if_cds_test_environment,
          sql_test_environment TYPE REF TO if_osql_test_environment,
          begin_date           TYPE /dmo/begin_date,
          end_date             TYPE /dmo/end_date,
          agency_mock_data     TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF /dmo/agency,
          customer_mock_data   TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF /dmo/customer,
          carrier_mock_data    TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF /dmo/carrier,
          flight_mock_data     TYPE STANDARD TABLE OF /dmo/flight.

        CLASS-METHODS:
          " setup test double framework
          class_setup,
          " stop test doubles
          class_teardown.

        METHODS:
          " reset test doubles
          setup,
          " rollback any changes
          teardown,

          " CUT: deep create with action call and commit
          deep_create_with_action FOR TESTING RAISING cx_static_check.
    </pre>
    </p>
    </details>
    

    The source code should now look as shown on the screenshot below.  
    An error will be displayed in the ABAP editor, because the appropriate method bodies are currently missing in the class implementations.  

    ![BO Test – Adjust Test Class](images/botestclass05.png)
 

    **Short explanation**:   
      - Static attributes:  
        -	**`cds_test_environment`**: The reference object for the CDS TDF (**`if_cds_test_environment`**) which is used to provide test doubles for the travel and booking CDS entities. The CDS test doubles will be used for _read_ operations.  
        -	**`sql_test_environment`**: The reference object for the ABAP SQL TDF (**`if_osql_test_environment`**) is used for stubing the additional needed database tables. The database test doubles will be used for _write_ operations.  
        -  **` deep_create_with_action`** is the unit test method for our CUT. Test methods are easily identified by the addition **`FOR TESTING`**.
      - The standard special methods of the test configuration  - i.e. **`setup`**, **`teardown`**, **`class_setup`**, and **`class_teardown`** - are specified.    

    **Reminder**: 
      -	Below is a simplified representation of the runtime flow of test classes.       
     ![BO Test – Adjust Test Class](images/testclassruntimeflow01.png)
 
2. Add the method bodies.    
    
    For that, set your cursor on **`class_setup`** or on the name of any of the unimplemented method names, press **Ctrl+1** to display the Quick Fix list, and select the entry **`+Add 5 unimplemented methods`** from the pop-up menu to create the empty method bodies for all unimplemented methods in the class implementation area.

    ![BO Test – Adjust Test Class](images/botestclass06.png)
 
   
3. Save ![save icon](images/adt_save.png) the class.

## Exercise 3.5: Implement the test method `deep_create_with_action`

The present CUT is a EML statement that will deep create a _travel_ instance with a _booking_ child instance and execute the `acceptTravel` action on it.
It means that the CUT is a complex EML statement which includes  `CREATE`, `EXECUTE` and  `COMMIT` statements .

1. Implement the test method **`deep_create_with_action`**.  
     
   Insert the code snippet provided below in the method body and replace all occurrences of **`####`** with your group ID.

    **<details><summary>Click here to expand the source code</summary>**

   **Short explanation:**  
    - (1) **CUT**: a complex **`MODIFY ENTITIES`** statement, including the following
        - a **`CREATE`** statement which creates a _travel_ instance (root).
    	- a deep **`CREATE`** statement which creates a _booking_ instance (child) to the create _travel instances.
    	- an **`EXECUTE`** statement which calls the action **`acceptTravel`** on the _travel_ instance.
    	- An assertion block used  to check for eventual failures and messages during the creation of the instances and the execution of the action – before committing the changes. 
    	- An assertion block used to check the returned **`mapped`** table for the created _travel_ and _booking_ instances. 
    	- A **`COMMIT ENTITIES`** statement which persist the changes to the database using the defined test doubles.
    - (2) **Result assertion**: The successful execution of the CUT is then verified using various assertion checks.   
        - An assertion block used to check for eventual failures and messages during the creation of the instances and the execution of the action. 
        - An assertion block used to check that the new _travel_ instance has been persisted on the database using the test doubles. It is preceded by a **`SELECT`** statement on the _travel_ interface view **`ZRAP400_I_Travel_####`**.
        - An assertion block used to check that the new _booking_ instance has been persisted on the database using the test doubles. This block is preceded by a **`SELECT`** statement on the _booking_ interface view **`ZRAP400_I_Booking_####`**

8.	Save ![save icon](images/adt_save.png) and activate ![activate icon](images/adt_activate.png) the changes.

9. Execute the implemented unit test.   

   For that, right-click on either the test method name **`deep_create_with_action`** or the test class name in the _**Outline**_ or _Project Explorer_ view, and select _**Run as > ABAP Unit Test**_ from the context menu or press **Ctrl+Shift+F10**.  

   ![BO Test – Execute Test Methods](images/botestclass12.png)
   
10. Now, run the unit test from the related behavior definition **`ZRAP400_I_Travel_####`**, where **`####`** is your group ID.

    In [Exercise 3.1](#exercise-31-create-the-abap-unit-test-class) of this document, you've specified the test relation to the behavior definition **`ZRAP400_I_Travel_####`** for this test class using the special ABAP Doc comment **`"! @testing BDEF:ZRAP400_I_Travel_####`**, where **`####`** is your group ID.   
 
    This means that every ABAP Unit tests implemented in this test class can be executed from the behavior definition **`ZRAP400_I_Travel_####`**.
  
    Select the BO behavior definition **`ZRAP400_I_Travel_####`** in the _**Project Explorer**_, right-click on it and select _**Run as > ABAP Unit Test**_ ( **Ctrl+Shift+F10**) from the context menu to executed all its related unit tests. 
    
    All units tests related to this behavior definition are executed and displayed under _**Forign Tests**_ in the _**ABAP Unit**_ view. Therefore, the unit tests written in the [Exercise 2](https://github.tools.sap/D040081/rap_workshops/blob/master/rap4xx/rap400/exercises/ex2/README.md) have also been executed.
